# SpringAOPExample
Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) is a powerful feature of the Spring Framework that allows you to separate cross-cutting concerns (like logging, security, and transaction management) from the core business logic. It helps in reducing code duplication and improving the maintainability of your application.

Key Concepts of Spring AOP:
Aspect: A module that encapsulates a cross-cutting concern.

Join Point: A point in the execution of a program, such as a method call or exception handling.

Advice: Action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. Types of advice include Before, After, AfterReturning, AfterThrowing, and Around.

Pointcut: A predicate that matches join points. It defines where the advice should be applied.

Weaving: The process of linking aspects with other application types to create an advised object.

Explanation:
Spring AOP Configuration Class:

@Configuration: Marks the class as a source of bean definitions.

@ComponentScan: Enables component scanning so that the Spring container can find and register beans in the specified package.

@EnableAspectJAutoProxy: Enables support for handling components marked with @Aspect annotations.

Service Class:

UserService is a simple service class with a method addUser that adds a user.

Aspect Class:

@Aspect: Marks the class as an aspect.

@Component: Marks the class as a Spring bean.

@Before: Advice that executes before the addUser method.

@After: Advice that executes after the addUser method.

The pointcut expression execution(* com.example.service.UserService.addUser(..)) matches the addUser method in the UserService class.

Main Class:

Loads the Spring configuration using AnnotationConfigApplicationContext.

Retrieves the UserService bean from the application context.

Calls the addUser method, triggering the aspect's before and after advice.
